Lung Tumor Detection YOLO Model

This project encompasses a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for detecting lung tumors, utilizing deep learning and object detection techniques. The YOLO model is a popular approach that simultaneously runs a single classifier and a bounding box regressor to efficiently detect objects in real time.

Project Objectives:
- Automatically detect lung tumors in chest X-ray images.
- Showcase the applicability of deep learning techniques in the field of medical imaging.
- Train the YOLO model on a curated dataset and evaluate its performance.

What We're Doing:
- Training the YOLO model using a pre-collected large dataset of chest X-ray images.
- Experimenting with various hyperparameters to achieve optimal results.
- Evaluating the trained model on test data and measuring detection accuracy.
- If results are promising, planning to assess the model's performance on real-world data.

How You Can Contribute:
